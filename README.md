Note: For tasks 0 to 23 (included), you have to deal with simple binary trees. They are not BSTs, thus they don’t follow any kind of rule.

Print function
To match the examples in the tasks, you are given this function

This function is used only for visualization purposes. You don’t have to push it to your repo. It may not be used during the correction
